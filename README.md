# psGitGithubAndTerminal
As the name suggests, this repo correlates with an assignment meant to familiarize students with using git, github, and the terminal.

[](#episode-x-a-new-terminal)Episode X: A New Terminal
------------------------------------------------------
A long time ago in a Unix environment far, far away, young Jedi padawans who knew only of desktop software were seduced by the dark side of the Force to enterâ€¦ The Terminal.

Follow the instructions below using all the console commands introduced in Fundamentals, class, or that you find on your own.

[](#setup)Setup
---------------
*   Open the **Terminal/HYPER app**
*   Inside the git-github-and-terminal folder, create another folder called: `galaxy-far-far-away`
*   Then create a file inside `galaxy-far-far-away` called `commands.txt`
*   Paste the answer to each numbered question (i.e. the command(s) that accomplished the task) in `commands.txt` once you get it to work
*   Remember, you can learn about any Unix command by typing `man` and then the command name. E.g., `man ls`. Type `Q` to get out of the Manual page ("man page") viewer


[](#part-i-set-the-scene)Part I: Set the Scene
----------------------------------------------
Complete all work inside the `galaxy-far-far-away` folder.
1.  Create a directory called `death_star`, and make the following files inside of it: `darth_vader.txt`, `princess_leia.txt`, `storm_trooper.txt`
2.  In `galaxy-far-far-away`, make a directory named `tatooine` and create the following files in it: `luke.txt`, `ben_kenobi.txt`
3.  Inside of `tatooine` make a directory called `millenium_falcon`, and in it create: `han_solo.txt`, `chewbaca.txt`

[](#part-ii-mv---rename)Part II: `mv` - rename
----------------------------------------------
You can rename a file using the `mv` command.
4.  Rename `ben_kenobi.txt` to `obi_wan.txt`

[](#part-ii-cp---copy)Part II: `cp` - copy
------------------------------------------
You can copy a file from one location to another using the `cp` command. (`man cp` for more info)
*   Directories can be sibling (parrell to each other) or can be parents (the folder that contains the folder you are in)
*   Copy `storm_trooper.txt` from `death_star` to `tatooine`

[](#part-iv-mv---move)Part IV: `mv` - move
------------------------------------------
You can use the `mv` command to move files from one location to another. `mv` can be used for renaming, moving, or both. Run `man mv` to see the optionsâ€”remember hit the `Q` key to get out of the manual page viewer.
6.  Move `luke.txt` and `obi_wan.txt` to the `millenium_falcon`
7.  Move `millenium_falcon` out of `tatooine` and into `galaxy-far-far-away`
8.  Move `millenium_falcon` into `death_star`
9.  Move `princess_leia.txt` into the `millenium_falcon`

[](#part-v-rm---remove)Part V: `rm` - remove
--------------------------------------------
**BE CAREFUL WITH `rm`!!! THERE IS NO "TRASH" IN THE UNIX CLI. WHEN YOU DELETE SOMETHING IT IS GONE FOREVER!!!**
You can use `rm` to delete a file.
10.  Delete `obi_wan.txt`.

[](#part-vi-all-together)Part VI: all together
----------------------------------------------
11.  In `galaxy-far-far-away`, make a directory called `yavin_4`
12.  Move the `millenium_falcon` out of the `death_star` and into `yavin_4`
13.  Make a directory in `yavin_4` called `x_wing`
14.  Move `princess_leia.txt` to `yavin_4` and `luke.txt` to `x_wing`
15.  Move the `millenium_falcon` and `x_wing` out of `yavin_4` and into `galaxy-far-far-away`
16.  In `death_star`, create directories for `tie_fighter_1`, `tie_fighter_2` and `tie_fighter_3`
17.  Move `darth_vader.txt` into `tie_fighter_1`
18.  Make a copy of `storm_trooper.txt` in both `tie_fighter_2` and `tie_fighter_3`
19.  Move all of the `tie_fighters` out of the `death_star` and into `galaxy-far-far-away`

[](#part-vii-rm--r-remove-directories-and-everything-they-contain)Part VII: `rm -r`: remove directories and everything they contain
----------------------------------------------
**BE CAREFUL WITH `rm -r` THERE IS NO TRASH CAN IN THE UNIX CLI. WHEN YOU DELETE SOMETHING IT IS GONE FOREVER**

Before you hit enter, make sure are deleting the right thing, or you could accidentally delete the contents of your computer (it has happened).

This command will not typically ask you if you "really want to delete." It will just delete.

### [](#celebrate-youve-reached-the-end-of-this-homework-)Celebrate. You've reached the end of this homework :)

[](#commit-and-push-your-updated-code)Commit and push your updated code:
----------------------------------------------

"Add" your changes (prepare them to be "committed"):
    $ git add -A

"Commit" your changesâ€”any time you make a commit, you can always restore the files in the repo to that point:
    $ git commit -m "Completed lab"

"Push" your commits to github:
    $ git push origin master

[](#conclusion)Conclusion
=========================
You will "git" plenty of practice as we progress through this program, so if the concept of git/github still seems a little fuzzy at this point, rest assured you will soon "git" it once you "git" some more practice in. ðŸ˜Ž
